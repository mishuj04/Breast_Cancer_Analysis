# Breast Cancer Analysis

## 📌 Dataset Overview
This dataset contains clinical and demographic information about breast cancer patients.  
The columns include:

- **Age**: Age of the patient  
- **Race**: Ethnicity of the patient  
- **Marital Status**: Current marital status  
- **T Stage**: Tumor size classification  
- **N Stage**: Lymph node involvement  
- **6th Stage**: AJCC 6th edition cancer stage  
- **differentiate**: Tumor differentiation level (well, moderate, poor, undifferentiated)  
- **Grade**: Tumor grade  
- **A Stage**: Cancer stage grouping  
- **Tumor Size**: Size of the tumor (mm)  
- **Estrogen Status**: Positive/Negative receptor status  
- **Progesterone Status**: Positive/Negative receptor status  
- **Regional Node Examined**: Number of regional nodes examined  
- **Regional Node Positive**: Number of positive nodes  
- **Survival Months**: Survival time in months  
- **Status**: Patient status (Alive/Dead)

## 🔍 Observations
#### 1. The average tumor size is higher among people belonging to other races compared to White or Black individuals.  
#### 2. Divorced individuals tend to have larger tumor sizes compared to married individuals.  
#### 3. People with undifferentiated tumors show larger tumor sizes.  
#### 4. Married individuals show longer survival months on average.  
#### 5. Well-differentiated tumors are associated with longer survival months.  
#### 6. A larger number of patients are diagnosed at **T2 stage** and **N1 stage**.  
#### 7. Grade 2 tumors are the most common among the patients.

## 📈 Key Conclusions
- **Social factors** (like marital status) appear to influence both tumor size and survival outcomes.  
- **Tumor biology** (differentiation, grade, receptor status) strongly impacts survival.  
- **Most patients are diagnosed in mid-level stages** (T2, N1, IIA, Regional A), suggesting the importance of early detection efforts.
